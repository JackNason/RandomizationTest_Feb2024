This is the python script I wrote to run a randomization test for a project on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) spawning.

It was used to assess the differences between different treatment groups of salmon, to see whether some groups spawned more than their counterparts.

To use this you will have to change a lot of the values to reflect your dataframe, as I left a lot of values in here that are specific to my original csv file.

Feel free to use this / take chunks of it.
